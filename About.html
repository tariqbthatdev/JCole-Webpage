            <p>Born in Frankfurt, Germany and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Jermaine Cole got into hip-hop through his stepfather's copy of 2Pacalypse Now, which led to a deep fascination with 2Pac and immersion in the work of Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, and Canibus, among many other artists. 
                <img class="about-band-image" src="images/jcole_roof.jpg"> Cole's high school grades earned him an academic scholarship to attend St. John's University in New York City. After numerous days spent outside Jay-Z's office in hopes of giving him a demo, weeks later by a call from the man, and was even more surprised to be asked to contribute to The Blueprint 3, heard on the appropriately titled "A Star Is Born." With only one mixtape in his discography, namely The Come Up -- boasting his own production credits beside those of major figures such as Salaam Remi, Large Professor, Just Blaze, and Kanye West -- Cole signed with Roc Nation. By the end of 2010, he issued two tapes for the label, The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights.</p>
            <p>Cole World: The Sideline Story, finally saw the light of day in 2011 and would go on to be certified platinum.Cole's sophomore album, Born Sinner, had its release date moved numerous times so as not to clash with other big releases. When it eventually came out in June 2013, it was another success, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent were among the guests. With momentum building, 2014 Forest Hills Drive came out in December 2014 and premiered at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, despite a lack of advance singles or marketing.</p> 
            <p>His fourth studio album, 4 Your Eyez Only, came out just before Christmas 2016 and also went to No. 1. The rapper's audience eagerly welcomed the April 2018 release of his fifth studio album, KOD, which shattered Spotify's opening-day streaming record en route to the Billboard top spot. The Off-Season was released on May 14, 2021. The album was co-executively produced by T-Minus and featured guest appearances from Morray, 21 Savage, Lil Baby, Bas, and 6LACK. It received positive reviews from critics and topped the US Billboard 200, selling 282,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, earning Cole his sixth consecutive number-one album in the country.</p>
            <p>He runs the Dreamville Records label with his former St. John's University classmate Ibrahim Hamad, releasing music by up-and-coming artists including Omen, Bas and Cozz. The label shares a name with his Dreamville Foundation, a non-profit Cole established in his hometown. Set up to “bridge the gap between the worlds of opportunity and the urban youth of Fayetteville, NC,” it runs a series of events and programs, including a reading club and essay contests.</p>
